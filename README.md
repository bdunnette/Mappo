## Introduction

Mappo is a web application based on Meteor (http://meteor.com/) to edit maps in real time.

I have not written a documentation yet. You can find some preliminary considerations here:

1. State of work: http://leibnizwheel.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/mappo-leaflet-mongodb-meteor-js/
2. Some idea about ui: http://leibnizwheel.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/beyond-mvc/
3. Initial motivations: http://leibnizwheel.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/meteor-js-for-geospatial-apps-some-experiments/

A draft of a getting started tutorial: http://leibnizwheel.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/cat-js-building-large-scale-web-applications/
