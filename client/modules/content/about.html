<h3>What is Mappo?</h3>

Mappo is a full fledge web framework to build geo applications easily.

I was not satisfied with client-side GIS because it often lacks of modularity and uses outdated technologies.
Hence, I decided to implement my own solution.

<h3>Mappo is a preview. What does it mean?</h3>

Mappo is under intensive development. Hence, its features and architecture can change very rapidly.
Nevertheless, it is mature enough to be used in your project. 
I realeased the code early because I value and I need your feedback.

<h3>Is Mappo open source?</h3>

Yes. It is. The license is aGPL. 

<h3>Who is behind Mappo?</h3>

Me! I am a freelance developer based in Italy. Have a look at <a href="http://blog.leibnizwheel.it">my blog</a>.

<h3>Where can I find support for Mappo?</h3>

Just drop me a line. :)

<h3>Can you customize Mappo on my needs?</h3>

I am available for consulting about Mappo and Meteor. If you have a crazy idea or an exciting problem, I look forward to joining in!
